# Lists: Adding and changing elements

# What is the keyword for adding a new element to the end of a list?

a = ["Detroit"]
a.append("")

# Using the append keyword, add the number 1 to the end of the list nums.

nums = [1, 2, 3]
nums.append(1)

# Using the keyword append, add the string "cat" to the end of the list pets.

cat = [""];
cat.append("cat");

# Using the keyword append, add the string "sun" to the end of the list stars.

sun = [""]
sun.append("sun");


# Code the alternative to the following statement, using the plus sign.
x = []

x = x + [5]

x.append(5)

# Using the plus sign instead of append, add two strings to the end of a list. Make up the list name and strings.

teams = ["detroit"]

teams = teams + ["a" + "b"]


# Insert the number 5 at the beginning of a list. M

number = []

number.insert(0, 5)

# In the following list, insert a string after "orange". Make up the string.

fruits = ["apple", "orange", "tangerine", "banana"]

fruits.insert(2, "grape")

# Fill in the blank to assign the fifth element of the list to the variable.


weekdays = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri"]

fifth_weekday = weekdays[4]
print(fifth_weekday)

# Using the plus sign rather than append, add two numbers to the end of a list and assign the result to a second list. Make up the list names and the numbers.
orginal_total = []

total = orginal_total + [1, 3]
