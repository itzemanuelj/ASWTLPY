## Dictionaries: The versatility of keys and values

## A key can be a string. It can also be a number

## A value paired with a key can be a number. It can also be a string

## The dictionary has just one item. The dictionary's name is products. The key is 101. The value is "wrench." Code the dictionary.

products = {101: 'wrench'}

## The dictionary has just one item. The dictionary's name is x. The key is "A12". The value is 9.99 Code the dictionary.

x = {'A12': 9.99}


## Code a dictionary with a single item. Both the key and the value are numbers. Make everything up.
numbers = {101: 100}
## Code a dictionary with a single item. Both the key and the value are strings. Make everything up.

first_names = {'name': 'justin'}

## Code a one-item dictionary. The key is a number. The value is a string. Make everything up.

customer = {'10893892:': 'justin'}

## Code a one-item dictionary. The key is a string. The value is a number. Make everything up.

my_dict = {'key': 42}

dicts = {
    'name': 'justin',
    'name': 'justin',
    'name': 'justin',
    'name': 'justin'
}

## Code a three-item dictionary, breaking the code into five lines. All keys are numbers. All values are strings. Make everything up.
list_of_5 = {
    1: 'one', 
    2: 'two', 
    3: 'three',
    4: 'four',
    5: 'five'
}

## Code a three-item dictionary, breaking it into five separate lines. Then display one of the values.

pets = {'pet1': 'dog',
        'pet2': 'cat',
        'pet3': 'goffer'
        }
print(pets['pet1'])

prices = {
  "screw": .03,
  "bolt": .075,
  "washer": .015,
}
print(prices["bolt"])

## Code a three-item dictionary on five lines. The keys are integers. The values are floats. Display the sum of the dictionary's three values.

nums = {
    1: 1.1,
    2: 2.2,
    3: 3.3    
}

print(nums[1]+ nums[2]+ nums[3])
