## Lists: Taking slices out of them

## In the following code, smaller_list_of_cities is assigned __ elements of the cities list. (Enter a numeral.)

cities = []

smaller_list_of_cities = cities[2:5]

3

## Fill in the blank. The first element in the slice is the second element in the list. The last element in the slice is the third element in the list.
smaller_list_of_cities = cities[1:3]

## Copy the second through eighth elements from the list y and assign the slice to the list x.

y = []

x = y[1:8]

## Reduce the list x to a slice of itselfâ€”the sixth through 8th elements.

x = x[5:8]

## Copy some elements from a list and assign the slice to another list. Make up the list names and the index numbers.

teams = ["detroit", "grosse pointe" , "eastpointe"]

sports_team = teams[1:3]

## What is the index number of the last element in the slice?
x = y[7:9]

## 8

## Fill in the blank to slice the first through ninth element with minimal coding.
x = y[:9]

## Using minimal coding, copy the fifth through last element from y and assign the slice to x.

y = x [4:]

## Copy the numbers 2 through 4 out of y and assign the slice to x.
y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

x = y[1:4]

## Using minimal coding, reduce the list x to its first five elements.

y = x[:5]

## Copy the middle two numbers out of list y and assign the slice to list x. Display list x.
y = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18]

y = x[3:5]
print(x)


## Using minimal coding, reduce the list x to "elm" and "chestnut." Then display the list.
x = ["elm", "chestnut", "oak", "palm", "fir"]
x = x[2]
print(x)
