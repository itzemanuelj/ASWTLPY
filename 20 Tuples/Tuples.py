## Tuples

## It's like a list, but the elements are fixed. What is it called?
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple)

## Recode this list to make it a tuple.
x = [10, 9]

x = (10, 9)

print(x)

## Define a tuple with two elements, "hi" and "bye". The tuple's name is greetings.

greeting = ("hi", "bye")

print(greeting)

##Define a tuple with two elements, 1 and 2. The tuple's name is nums.

nums = (1, 2)
print(nums)

## Rewrite this so you can make changes to the elements.
sizes = ("sm", "med", "lg", "xl")

sizes = ["sm", "med", "lg", "xl"]

print(sizes)

numbers = (1, 2, 3 ,4)
print(numbers)

## Concatenate the second element of tuple x with the third element of tuple y. In the concatenation include a comma and space in the middle. Assign the concatenated string to a variable. Make up the variable name.

x = (3, "Hello", "Howdy", "Greetings")
y = ("earth", "sun", "World", "Pluto", 144)

greeting = x[1] + ", " + y[2]

## Code a tuple with three elementsâ€”your first, middle, and last names. Make up the tuple name.

name = ("justin", "emanuel", "jones")
print(name)

## Code a tuple with three numbers. Make up the tuple name and the numbers.

three_nums = (1, 2, 3)
print(three_nums)

##Code a tuple with three elements that are strings. Then, in a single line, append the last element to a list. Make up the names and strings.

##fruits = ("apple", "orange", "bannana")
##fruits.append(fruits[2])

## create a tuple with at least two elements. Then display the second element.

times = (1, 2, 3)
print(times[1])

## Insert an element of the tuple into the first position (index 0) in the list. Then display the list.

list = [4, 5, 6]
tuple = (1, 2, 3)

list.insert(0, tuple[2])
print(list)
